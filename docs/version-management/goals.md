# Goals for Node.js and Package Manager Version Management Effort

Help application developers to:

1. Define the correct Node.js runtime version and package manager version for projects.

1. Install Node.js and a package manager for a local development environment.

1. Run different versions of Node.js and different versions of package managers for different projects, deterministically.
